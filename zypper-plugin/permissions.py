# Basically we communicate to zypper via stdin/stdout, a special protocol is
# exchanged here.
#
# The COMMITBEGIN and COMMITEND hooks allow to inspect which packages are
# installed or removed. We can't look at individual files, though. Therefore
# we have to blindly call chkstat at the end of each transaction that adds one
# or more packages.
